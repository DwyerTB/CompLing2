Goal of Project
For my final project, I attempted to make a program that could take a tree data structure with an indicated WH-element in its base positions (where there are initially merged into the tree) and return a tree structure for the same sentence represented by the original tree, but with the WH-element’s copies (Boskovic & Nunes, 2007; Chomsky, 2005) in the specifiers of the phase edges it passed through during WH-movement. Sentences to base the tree structures on were to be original English data and Mon data from Gould 2021. The output trees were meant to indicate which copies are overt at the phonological level.
